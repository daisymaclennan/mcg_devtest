# mcg_devtest
This project was part of the hiring process for my job at MCG/DBLX/Huler. I was given an image of the front page of the design and then had the freedom to create whatever I wanted from that. I decided to create a horizontal scrolling effect and then altered the moving speed of the main image so it was still in the frame on the second slide.
